# Rest-Cli

## Simple Postman alternative
Born from frustrations from Electron apps like Postman, Insomnia...

### Why:
I was always more for native applications instead for a hybrid not because they are faster and smaller but also that they are consuming fewer computing resources. Nowadays, probably we don't have to worry about computing power, but working with many different services at the same time is always slowing down your PC and for that reason Rest-Cli was born, as an answer and requirement.

### Features:
- Open Source
- Purely developed in Go with Fyne UI
- Simple UI
- No WebViews
- SQLite for keeping requests data and configuration
- ...

### Installation
Because right now is still in development, there are not any plans for official release soon, the only way to use it Rest-Cli right now it to clone develop branch and compile by yourself.
